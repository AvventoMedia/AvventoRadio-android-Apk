   "warning":"The government of Uganda disconnected internet on Wed 13/Jan/2021 which affected our programming and restored it on Mon 18/Jan/2021 although not all sites are accessible, social media etc is still blocked. We praise the Lord AvventoRadio remained on air all through that period. The weekend sermons and Adult sabbath school share programs unfortunately were never updated and we rebroadcasted the former week's programs. We hope to manage this better next time when such a non expected event happens. Stay tuned"
